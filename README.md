# Advanced-PDE-Notes
 
Typed lecture notes for Imperial College London's Advanced Topics for Partial Differential Equations (Anna Kostianko, 2023). Transcribed by Harry Li.

The typed notes contains material from lectures 10 to 18. As I have finished studying this module, these notes will not be updated further by me.
